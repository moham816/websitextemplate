Per Travis:

Please have your contributions submitted by Friday, 04/08/16. 

Once everyone has made their submissions on Friday, 04/08/2016 then Travis or myself will merge all submissions on Friday night with the master file. 

The team can then RE-DOWNLOAD THE ENTIRE ZIP ON Saturday, 04/09/2016 to have an updated project file. 

This will allow us to ensure our changes are functional and also see what areas of the site need work or more content.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Melissa
